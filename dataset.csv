961455cd9d5a09f99612eb6a0edb575b9c308b82#hbase#[jira] [HBASE-5074] Support checksums in HBase- block cache--Author: Dhruba--Summary:-HFile is enhanced to store a checksum for each block. HDFS checksum verification-is avoided while reading data into the block cache. On a checksum verification-failure, we retry the file system read request with hdfs checksums switched on-(thanks Todd).--I have a benchmark that shows that it reduces iops on the disk by about 40%. In-this experiment, the entire memory on the regionserver is allocated to the-regionserver's jvm and the OS buffer cache size is negligible. I also measured-negligible (<5%) additional cpu usage while using hbase-level checksums.--The salient points of this patch:--1. Each hfile's trailer used to have a 4 byte version number. I enhanced this so-that these 4 bytes can be interpreted as a (major version number, minor-version). Pre-existing hfiles have a minor version of 0. The new hfile format-has a minor version of 1 (thanks Mikhail). The hfile major version remains-unchanged at 2. The reason I did not introduce a new major version number is-because the code changes needed to store/read checksums do not differ much from-existing V2 writers/readers.--2. Introduced a HFileSystem object which is a encapsulates the FileSystem-objects needed to access data from hfiles and hlogs.  HDFS FileSystem objects-already had the ability to switch off checksum verifications for reads.--3. The majority of the code changes are located in hbase.io.hfie package. The-retry of a read on an initial checksum failure occurs inside the hbase.io.hfile-package itself.  The code changes to hbase.regionserver package are minor.--4. The format of a hfileblock is the header followed by the data followed by the-checksum(s). Each 16 K (configurable) size of data has a 4 byte checksum.  The-hfileblock header has two additional fields: a 4 byte value to store the-bytesPerChecksum and a 4 byte value to store the size of the user data-(excluding the checksum data). This is well explained in the associated-javadocs.--5. I added a test to test backward compatibility. I will be writing more unit-tests that triggers checksum verification failures aggressively. I have left a-few redundant log messages in the code (just for easier debugging) and will-remove them in later stage of this patch. I will also be adding metrics on-number of checksum verification failures/success in a later version of this-diff.--6. By default, hbase-level checksums are switched on and hdfs level checksums-are switched off for hfile-reads. No changes to Hlog code path here.--Test Plan: The default setting is to switch on hbase checksums for hfile-reads,-thus all existing tests actually validate the new code pieces. I will be writing-more unit tests for triggering checksum verification failures.--Reviewers: mbautin--Reviewed By: mbautin--CC: JIRA, tedyu, mbautin, dhruba, todd, stack--Differential Revision: https://reviews.facebook.net/D1521--git-svn-id: https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/hbase/trunk@1298641 13f79535-47bb-0310-9956-ffa450edef68-#a#0#0#0#0#30#50#3#2#1#1#0#14#29#0#2#16#20#0#9#22#6#5#2#36#0#1#0#0#0#0#0#0#0#0#1#0#1#0#0#0#0#0#89#148#0#2#131#0#0#0#0#1#0#0#0#0#0#0#0#1#0#0#0#0#1#1#1#1

28174744a74e08cc974a54041e304dc4aafa5334#spring-framework#Fix race when flushing messages--The use of an AtomicBoolean and no lock meant that it was possible-for a message to be queued and then never be flushed and sent to the-broker:--1. On t1, a message is received and isConnected is false. The message-   will be queued.-2. On t2, CONNECTED is received from the broker. isConnected is set-   to true, the queue is drained and the queued messages are forwarded-3. On t1, the message is added to the queue--To fix this, checking that isConnected is false (step 1 above) and the-queueing of a message (step 3 above) need to be performed as a unit-so that the flushing of the queued messages can't be interleaved. This-is achieved by synchronizing on a monitor and performing steps 1-and 3 and synchronizing on the same monitor while performing step 2.--The monitor is held while the messages are actually being forwarded-to the broker. An alternative would be to drain the queue into-a local variable, release the monitor, and then forward the messages.-The main advantage of this alternative is that the monitor is held for-less time. It also reduces the theoretical risk of deadlock by not-holding the monitor while making an alien call. The downside of the-alternative is that it may lead to messages being forwarded out of-order. For this reason the alternative approach was rejected.-#c#0#0#0#0#0#2#0#0#0#0#0#0#0#0#0#1#0#0#0#0#0#0#0#0#0#0#0#0#0#0#0#0#0#0#0#1#0#0#0#0#0#0#2#3#0#4#2#0#0#0#0#0#0#0#1#0#0#0#0#0#0#0#0#0#1#0#0#1

2ec7834124dfa32d7b90afbb23805433a4567bf5#spring-framework#Resolve nested placeholders via PropertyResolver--Prior to this change, PropertySourcesPropertyResolver (and therefore-all AbstractEnvironment) implementations failed to resolve nested-placeholders as in the following example:--    p1=v1-    p2=v2-    p3=${v1}:{$v2}--Calls to PropertySource-getProperty for keys 'p1' and 'v1' would-successfully return their respective values, but for 'p3' the return-value would be the unresolved placeholders. This behavior is-inconsistent with that of PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer.--PropertySourcesPropertyResolver -getProperty variants now resolve any-nested placeholders recursively, throwing IllegalArgumentException for-any unresolvable placeholders (as is the default behavior for-PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer). See SPR-9569 for an enhancement that-will intoduce an 'ignoreUnresolvablePlaceholders' switch to make this-behavior configurable.--This commit also improves error output in-PropertyPlaceholderHelper-parseStringValue by including the original-string in which an unresolvable placeholder was found.--Issue: SPR-9473, SPR-9569-#c#0#0#0#0#1#0#0#0#0#0#0#0#0#0#0#0#0#0#0#0#0#0#0#0#0#0#0#0#0#0#0#0#0#0#0#0#0#0#0#0#0#0#0#2#0#0#1#0#0#0#0#1#1#1#0#1#1#0#0#0#0#0#0#0#0#0#0#0
